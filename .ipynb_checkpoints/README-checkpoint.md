# Image-Classification
### Install requried libraries in your system following "Install Required Libraries.ipynb" instructions.
#### What are the purposes of this Repo:
* Step 1: Develope and train a very basic and simple classification model to differentiate between John Wick vs Rambo photos using "Training.ipynb" scripts.
* Step 2: Convert the model I trained in previous step into two formats: ONNX and Keras using "Training.ipynb" scripts.
* Step 3: Evaluate the ONNX model to check if we loose accuracy in conversion step using "ONNX Evaluation.ipynb" scripts.
* Step 4: Convert the ONNX model into TensorRT Engine using Google Colab using "Convert ONNX to TRT.ipynb" scripts.
* Step 5: Evaluate the TensorRT engine model to check if we loose accuracy in conversion step using "TRT Inference.ipynb" scripts.
